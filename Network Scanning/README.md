## Network Scanning

Scanning helps to detect all the active hosts and their ports on a network and maps them to their IP addresses. Scanners send a packet or ping to every possible IP address and wait for a response to determine the status of the applications or devices (hosts). The responding hosts and ports are considered active, while others are considered dead or inactive. These responses are then scanned to detect inconsistencies.

# Offensive-Pentesting-Host
Penetration testing is the practice of launching authorized, simulated attacks against computer systems and their physical infrastructure to expose potential security weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

Network Penetration Testing determines vulnerabilities in the network posture by discovering Open ports, Troubleshooting live systems, services and grabbing system banners.

The pen-testing helps administrator to close unused ports, additional services, Hide or Customize banners, Troubleshooting services and to calibrate firewall rules.You should test in all ways to guarantee there is no security loophole
Letâ€™s see how we conduct a step by step Network penetration testing
